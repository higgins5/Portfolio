### In-Progress Manuscripts 

1. **Higgins, E. T.**, Busse, W. W., Klaus, D., Grupe, D. W., Davidson, R. J., & Rosenkranz, M. A. (in progress). Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction alters neural responses associated with asthma outcomes.  

    **Abstract**: Psychological distress negatively impacts asthma control, airway inflammation, and treatment efficacy, suggesting crosstalk between the brain and disease symptoms in asthma. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which promotes non-judgmental attention to internal and external cues, can benefit psychological and physical symptoms in chronic inflammatory diseases, including increasing asthma control. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying these benefits in asthma could help identify phenotypes and personalize interventions for asthma. Adults with asthma were randomized to an 8-week MBSR training (n = 35) or wait-list control group (n = 34). Clinically relevant asthma-related and psychological outcomes were collected, and task-based functional magnetic resonance scans were acquired during the presentation of emotionally-salient cues at baseline, post-intervention, and 6mo follow-up. Mindfulness training decreased lateral prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex responses to emotionally-salient cues relative to wait-list controls, which was associated with increased self-reported mindfulness. Additionally, reductions in psychological distress and inflammation were associated with decreased neural reactivity in the insula/frontal-opercular cortex (IFOC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala for all participants immediately post-intervention. At 6-month follow-up, though some relationships persisted, MBSR-related improvements in asthma control, severity, and overall distress were associated with increased neural reactivity in medial prefrontal and IFOC regions. In the first study to investigate MBSRâ€™s effects on neural responses to aversive cues and disease outcomes in adults with asthma, decreased neural reactivity associated with increased mindfulness suggests a reduced need for effortful cognitive-affective regulation immediately post-intervention. For all participants, reduced neural reactivity was associated with reduced distress and inflammation, supporting the hypothesis that cognitive-affective processing is integrated with peripheral inflammation in asthma. At the 6mo follow-up, additional associations between improved symptoms and increased neural reactivity point to increased effortful regulation. Overall, MBSR alters the reactivity and regulation of neural responses to emotionally-salient cues, which predicts symptom improvements. Results here shed light on neural mechanisms that may underlie clinical benefits of MBSR for asthma, and highlight the importance of addressing mind-body relationships in asthma management.

M., Schaefer, S. M. (in progress). Associations among lifetime stressor severity, cortisol responses to acute stress, and amygdala and hippocampal volumes.  

    **Abstract**: Severe stress is linked to structural changes in the amygdala and hippocampus, limbic regions with roles in regulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses to acute stress. Yet, how these amygdalar and hippocampal structural changes may in turn influence subsequent acute biological stress responses remains unclear. 249 individuals (aged 25-65) completed the Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN), underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and provided salivary cortisol samples during their reactivity to and recovery from a psychosocial stress paradigm, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Linear regression and piecewise mixed-effects models were used to examine relations between lifetime stressor severity, amygdalar and hippocampal volumes, and cortisol response patterns. Lifetime stressor severity from the STRAIN was associated with both smaller amygdala and hippocampal volumes, adjusted for intracranial volume (ICV) and cohort (data collected before vs. after Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns), but only associations with the hippocampus remained at trend when age, sex at birth, and race were included in the model. Flatter cortisol reactivity and recovery patterns and lower peak cortisol were associated with smaller amygdala and hippocampal volumes and greater lifetime stressor severity. These results confirm the expected intersections between stress exposure, amygdalar and hippocampal structure, and cortisol response dynamics of acute stress responses such that more severe lifetime stress is associated with smaller amygdalar and hippocampal volumes and flatter cortisol reactivity and recovery patterns to acute laboratory stress.

(2024, June). *Brain and cortisol responses to psychosocial stress are associated with provoked airway inflammation in Th17-related pathways in asthma.* Presentated at the 2024 Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society Annual Meeting, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.  

    **Abstract:** Individuals with asthma, a widespread chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, suffer increased prevalence and impact of stress, depression, and anxiety. Emotion-related neurocircuitry, activated by psychological stress, may intensify airway inflammatory responses. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms and descending pathways important in the context of acute stress and allergen exposure. In a within-subjects design with 28 adults with asthma, we measured brain glucose metabolism during the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a non-stressful control task using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET). Salivary cortisol was collected during the stress/control task and PET scan, to quantify physiological stress responses. Airway inflammation was measured using fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), sputum % eosinophils, and expression of mRNA from cytokines produced by Th17 cells, before and 24hr after airway provocation with whole-lung allergen challenge (WL-AG). Acute stress significantly increased salivary cortisol (stats), but did not significantly increase airway inflammation overall. Following stress, salivary cortisol was correlated with IL-23A mRNA expression (t(22.1) = 2.38, p = 0.026) and FeNO (t(21.5) = 2.17, p = 0.041). In the brain, acute psychosocial stress was associated with increased glucose metabolism in the cerebellum and decreased motor cortex activity, relative to the control condition. Salivary cortisol was positively correlated with glucose metabolism in regions including the salience network. Importantly, acute stress-evoked salience network glucose metabolism predicted increased IL-23A mRNA expression following WL-AG. Results advance our understanding of the efferent arm of the lung-brain axis in humans. Although acute stress did not significantly increase airway inflammation in the whole group, results indicate that individual differences in brain and cortisol responses to acute psychosocial stress are associated with provoked airway inflammation in Th17-related pathways. This work motivates the need to tailor asthma interventions to individual variation in pulmonary and extrapulmonary processes in airway diseases.

Acute psychosocial stress was associated with increased glucose metabolism in the cerebellum and decreased motor cortex activity, relative to the control condition. Significantly increased cortisol during stress was positively correlated with glucose metabolism in regions including those in the salience network, and correlated with IL-23A mRNA expression (t(22.1) = 2.38, p = .026) and FeNO (t(21.5) = 2.17, p = .041) following stress. Importantly, stress-evoked amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity predicted increased IL-23A mRNA expression following WL-AG. Contrary to hypotheses, however, acute stress did not significantly increase airway inflammation. This project advances the understanding of the efferent arm of the lung-brain axis in humans. Results indicate that individual differences in brain and cortisol responses to acute psychosocial stress are associated with provoked airway inflammation in the Th17 pathway. This work moves us closer to tailoring asthma prevention and treatment to individual differences in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary processes in airway diseases.

5. **Higgins, E. T.**, Busse, W. W., Esnault, S., Klaus, D. R., & Rosenkranz, M. A. (2023, June). *Chronic Stress Moderates Effects of Acute Stress on Allergen-Induced Asthmatic Inflammation.* Presented virtually at the 2023 Plasticity of Well-being Summer Workshop, Madison, WI.  

    **Abstract:** Neurocircuitry recruited by psychological stress may magnify asthmatic airway inflammation, but little is known about the neural and molecular mechanisms. During the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), we measured brain glucose metabolism (FDG-PET) and salivary cortisol. Airway inflammation was measured before and 24hr after airway allergen challenge (AG). Higher chronic stress predicted less increase in sputum eosinophils but greater increase in IL-17 mRNA expression following TSST and AG. Increased cortisol during the TSST correlated with greater salience network activation, which also predicted greater IL-23A and less CCL2 mRNA expression. Overall, chronic stress moderated acute stressâ€™ effects on AG-induced airway inflammation, and TSST-related neural activity predicted IL-17 pathway signaling. Results offer insight into brain-to-lung signaling following acute stress, superimposed on varying levels of chronic stress, which may impact which inflammatory pathways AG exposure engages.

    **Abstract:** Asthma is a highly prevalent airway disease marked by episodic and recurrent respiratory symptoms and increased prevalence and impact of stress, depression, and anxiety. Psychological stress intensifies airway inflammatory responses, likely contributing to individual differences in asthma pathobiology and incomplete symptom management. Given the role of Th17-associated pathways in both airway inflammation and psychological distress, they may link emotion-related neurocircuitry and asthmatic inflammation. However, the neural mechanisms and descending pathways by which psychological stress impacts asthmatic inflammation are largely unknown. To assess the effects of acute stress on neurocircuitry, we measured brain glucose metabolism during the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) using [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tractography. Salivary cortisol was collected to quantify physiological stress responses. Airway inflammatory measurements were acquired before and 24hr after airway provocation with whole-lung allergen challenge (WL-AG). Salivary cortisol area under the curve (AUC) was significantly greater during the TSST, relative to control condition (t(50) = -2.8, p = .007). Cortisol also showed a quadratic trend over time during the TSST, relative to control condition (t(319) = -4.15, p < .001). Stress-evoked cortisol AUC was positively correlated with glucose metabolism in the bilateral insulae, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), R amygdala, and cerebellum. Importantly, stress-evoked neural activity in bilateral amygdalae predicted increased expression of IL-23A mRNA in sputum following WL-AG. Results confirm that a greater physiological response to stress is associated with increased neural activity in stress- and emotion-responsive regions. Moreover, correlations between stress-evoked bilateral amygdalae activation and subsequent increased IL-23A mRNA expression following allergen challenge support our hypothesis that stress-related neurocircuitry predicts enhanced inflammatory signaling capacity. These results provide insight into potential brain-to-lung signaling pathways in response to psychosocial stress, which may ultimately suggest novel targets for asthma management.

7. **Higgins, E. T.**, Davidson, R. J., & Rosenkranz, M. A. (2022, September). *Brain functional changes associated with mindfulness training in asthma.* Presentation at the Autumn School Mini Congress, Castle Rauischholzhausen, Ebsdorfergrund, Germany.  

    **Abstract:** Psychological distress can negatively impact asthma control, airway inflammation, and treatment efficacy. Interventions that target emotion reactivity and regulation, such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), have shown benefit in improving asthma control. Brain networks involved in emotion-processing have been linked to both mindfulness practice and asthma-related immune modulation; however, whether regions within these networks mediate MBSRâ€™s impact on disease-related outcomes is unknown. Adults with asthma were randomized to an 8-week MBSR training (n = 35) or wait-list control group (n = 34). At baseline, post-intervention, and 4months post-intervention, we collected clinically-relevant asthma and psychological outcomes, and functional magnetic resonance imaging in response to emotionally-salient cues. Mindfulness training decreased amygdala and lateral prefrontal cortex responses to emotionally-salient cues relative to wait-list controls, which was correlated with MBSR-related increases in mindfulness. Additionally, increased anterior cingulate cortex response was associated with MBSR-related asthma control improvements and decreased depressive symptoms, but also with decreased mindfulness and increased distress over time. For both groups, reduced insula responses to emotionally-salient cues correlated with decreased distress and inflammation. In asthmatic adults, MBSR training changed neural responses to emotionally-salient cues, which was associated with increased mindfulness and asthma control. This suggests that mindfulness training alters the reactivity and regulation of neural responses to emotionally-salient cues, which predicts symptom improvements. In all participants, decreased neural responses in emotion-relevant regions correlated with reduced distress and inflammation, advancing understandings of the complex neural mechanisms linking emotion and asthma. Overall, our results highlight the importance of targeting mind-body relationships in asthma treatment.

## Teaching and Mentoring

**bring in something from NSF importance of mentorship** 
Throughout my graduate career, I have prioritized statistics-related mentorship and *something*.  
During my post-baccalaureate internship, I led several statistical presentations and discussions at Rosenkranz Lab meetings, including topics such as Piecewise Linear Mixed Models (presentation slides [here](https://github.com/higgins5/Portfolio/blob/main/documents/presentations/PiecewiseLMEM.pdf)), Advanced Outlier Detection (slides [here](https://github.com/higgins5/Portfolio/blob/main/documents/presentations/Cook'sD_EffectSizes.pdf)), and Multiple Imputation in Longitudinal/Mixed Model Analyses (slides [here](https://github.com/higgins5/Portfolio/blob/main/documents/presentations/multipleimputation.pdf)). I also provided statistical guidance and visualizations to collaborators for multilevel modeling of salivary cortisol data.  
Beyond my role in undergraduate mentorship, I have been (DSHB students)


In the spring of 2023, I worked closely with an honors neuroscience undergraduate senior to provide statistical guidance, writing and poster feedback, and career-related mentorship. We are currently finalizing a co-first-author manuscript *what it's about*. She completed an NIH Post-Baccalaureate and will start her PhD at Yale University this fall.  
I am currently supervising an undergraduate in our initial stages of data collection and have advised her on two small independent research project. As a 2025 Hilldale Fellow, her senior honors project (Psychology/Neurobiology) will focus on the relationships among asthma, depression, and gut microbiota.  
I am excited to continue directly advising undergraduates.
